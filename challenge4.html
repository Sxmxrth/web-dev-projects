          The MacBook Air is a line of notebook computers developed and
          manufactured by Apple Inc. It consists of a full-size keyboard, a
          machined aluminum case, and, in the more modern versions, a thin light
          structure. The Air was originally positioned above the previous
          MacBook line as a premium ultraportable. Since then, the original
          MacBook's discontinuation in 2011, and lowered prices on subsequent
          iterations, have made the Air Apple's entry-level notebook. In the
          current product line, the MacBook Air is situated below the
          performance range MacBook Pro.

          The MacBook Pro is a line of Macintosh notebook computers introduced
          in January 2006 by Apple Inc. It is the higher-end model of the
          MacBook family, sitting above the consumer-focused MacBook Air, and is
          currently sold with 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch screens. All models
          from the current lineup use variants of the Apple-designed M1 system
          on a chip. The first-generation MacBook Pro used the design of the
          PowerBook G4, but replaced the PowerPC G4 chips with Intel Core
          processors, added a webcam, and introduced the MagSafe power
          connector. The 15-inch model was introduced in January 2006; the
          17-inch model in April. Later revisions added Intel Core 2 Duo
          processors and LED-backlit displays.

          iMac is a family of all-in-one Macintosh desktop computers designed
          and built by Apple Inc. It has been the primary part of Apple's
          consumer desktop offerings since its debut in August 1998, and has
          evolved through seven distinct forms. In its original form, the iMac
          G3 had a gumdrop or egg-shaped look, with a CRT monitor, mainly
          enclosed by a colored, translucent plastic case, which was refreshed
          early on with a sleeker design notable for its slot-loaded optical
          drive. The second major revision, the iMac G4, moved the design to a
          hemispherical base containing all the main components and an LCD
          monitor on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third and fourth
          major revisions, the iMac G5 and the Intel iMac respectively, placed
          all the components immediately behind the display, creating a slim
          unified design that tilts only up and down on a simple metal base.

          Apple Watch is a line of smartwatches produced by Apple Inc. It
          incorporates fitness tracking, health-oriented capabilities, and
          wireless telecommunication, and integrates with iOS and other Apple
          products and services. The Apple Watch was released in April 2015 and
          quickly became the best-selling wearable device: 4.2 million were sold
          in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, and more than 100 million people
          were estimated to use an Apple Watch as of December 2020.[22] Apple
          has introduced new generations of the Apple Watch with improved
          internal components each Septemberâ€”each labeled by Apple a 'Series',
          with certain exceptions.
